# SciCalc
This project has been made by me while i was learning js , html and css.
This repository ia a online-calculator which is capable of doing basic caluclations as well as it is also provided with some basic scientific functions such as log() ,sqrt(), trignometric functions like sin , cos , tan and their inverses , exponential-calculations such as x^y(x to the power y/x power y), floor and ceil functions.
A seperate panel containing these buttons is provided.
"Sc" button persent at the bottom left has to be pressed to summon the panel, same can be done to make it vanish in case one doesn't need to make use of these functions.   
Also options of some universal constants such as PI and e(napier's constant) has been provided incase of direct use of the values.  
This repository involves usage of three files . The index.html which contains structure of the web page, style.css which is the css file and script.js i.e the java-script file.
This repository as mentioned above is been made as a part of learning process of html,css and js . 
So there is a possiblity that bugs might cease to exist; which i am trying to rectify by testing the code.  
Feel free to  clone my repository and experiment with the code , apply style and modify logic as per your wish.
